      <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
    <h4>The first thing I noticed was the loading animation, which made it feel like I was launching a new app.
        <br>Then, the large text "Welcome to the Luniverse" immediately gave me the feeling of entering a new world, creating a strong sense of belonging.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.<h3></h3>
    <h4>I spent two minutes interacting with various 3D objects, playing mini-games like soccer and basketball,
        <br>and experimenting with small interactive elements like a laptop, fried eggs, and a punching bag.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
  

    <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <h4>I was impressed by hovering over objects and watching how the 3D elements popped up and rotated based on the mouse movement.
        <br>It was fun seeing how the perspective changed dynamically.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <h4>The site had smooth, soft transitions that made the interactions feel seamless when scrolling and hovering over elements.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <h4>I think the primary goal seems to be immersing users in a playful, interactive digital space while introducing Luni as a next-generation brand.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <h4>Through engaging 3D interactions, fun mini-games, and an open-ended exploration style, it makes users feel like they are stepping into a unique digital universe.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <h4>It felt like an experience designed to be revisited multiple times, as there are many interactive elements and hidden details to discover.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <h4>The smooth transitions, dynamic 3D effects, and game-like interactions suggest that users should explore the site at their own pace and return to experience more.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <h4>This website references the metaverse, digital games, and immersive web experiences, positioning itself as a futuristic and interactive brand platform.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <h4>I was engaged with curiosity and playfulness, exploring the space freely rather than following a strict structure.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <h4>It received a sense of excitement, adventure, and curiosity, making users feel like they are part of something futuristic and innovative.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
    <h4>Because the website felt like a 3D world, the longer I looked at the site, I felt more tired and slightly dizzy.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
    <h4>The way the 3D objects reacted to the mouse movement made the whole experience feel immersive and futuristic.
        <br>Additionally, the low-saturation color palette combined with the cute 3D objects created a cozy and charming atmosphere.</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
