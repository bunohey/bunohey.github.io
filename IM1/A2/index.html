            “When I first stepped onto this land, I could hear the wind speaking. The trees, the rivers, even the stones — they all seemed to hold a story.
            Time moves differently here. The line between yesterday and tomorrow is soft, and the songs of long ago still echo in the air.
            They call it The Dreaming — not the past, but a living presence that breathes in every part of this place.
            Then came the tall ships, and with them, silence. Children were taken, languages forbidden, songs pushed underground.
            But quiet doesn’t mean forgotten. The stories kept moving — in the soil, in the eyes of elders, in hands passing down ceremony.
            For the First Peoples, land isn’t something you own. It’s something that holds you, teaches you, remembers you.
            The land is a mother, a memory, a silent language. And to understand any of this, you have to first listen.
            Sit with the silence, feel the weight of grief and joy that lives here. That’s where the truth begins.
            That’s where the breathing of this land continues.”
