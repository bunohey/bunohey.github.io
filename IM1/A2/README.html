<h2> Short Description </h2>

<p> The Indigenous Music Player is a music player designed to immerse users in the sound and visual experience of Australian Indigenous music. It integrates music playback controls with a focus on Indigenous culture and history, aiming to communicate the pain and historical truths of Indigenous peoples through both the audio and visual design. </p>

<h3> Features: </h3>

<li>Music Playback: Includes play/pause, skip, repeat, and shuffle with a draggable playlist to rearrange songs.

<li> Progress Bar: Tracks the song’s progress and allows users to seek different parts of the track.

<li> Vinyl Record Animation: A visual element that spins with the music, creating a tactile connection to the rhythm.

<li> Indigenous Music Focus: The playlist features songs represents Indigenous history and culture, providing an emotional and educational experience.

<li> Scrolling Text: Inspirational and historical quotes about Indigenous peoples scroll in the background, adding context and promoting reflection on the music’s deeper meaning.

<p> This project combines music and visuals to create a meaningful interaction with Indigenous culture, encouraging users to learn and reflect on the history and resilience of Indigenous peoples. Given that many of the songs in the playlist are instrumental or feature minimal lyrics, the design also incorporates a digital media art element in the background, evoking a sense of gratitude. This digital art aesthetic enhances the connection to the music’s themes and provides a visually reflective atmosphere. </p>
