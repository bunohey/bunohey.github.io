    <!------------------------------ Q&A ------------------------------>
    <h2>꧁✬◦°⋆⋆°◦. 𝒬𝓊ℯ𝓈𝓉𝒾ℴ𝓃𝓈 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝒜𝓃𝓈𝓌ℯ𝓇𝓈 ◦°⋆⋆°◦✬꧂</h2>

    <h3>Q1. What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h3>
    <h5>It is an educational biology game, similar to a simulation puzzle.</h5>

    <h3>Q2. List three other examples of software in this genre</h3>
    <h5><li>The Powder Toy: It is also a falling-sand game with a physics engine (gravity, velocity, air pressure, etc). Players can freely place objects to experiment with and observe chemical interactions between materials.</li>
      <li>The Sims: The player can freely place objects and characters, which interact with each other. The player must also fulfill their needs.</li>
      <li>Terra Nil: Ultimate goal of this is restoring barren land and strategically rebuilding the ecosystem to a thriving state.</li>
    </h5>
      

    <h3>Q3. List the program's interactive yfeatures/mechanics (one sentence max explanation per feature/mechanic)</h3>
    <h5><li>Physics engine: Based on a sandbox game, when nature elements are placed, sand flows, water moves, light objects float in the water, and grass sways.</li>
      <li>Realistic ecosystem: Day and night cycles influence and interact with organisms through their life cycles, such as grass growing, while fluctuating CO2 and O2 levels can cause fish to die, affecting the balance of the ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Food chain: The ecosystem is clearly divided into autotrophs, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers, and is continuously maintained within the aquarium.</li>
      <li>Autonomy in creation and exploration: The player can freely create and experiment within the aquarium, observing the interactions and influences between the different elements of the ecology.</li>
    </h5>

    <h3>Q4. What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h3>
    <h5><li>Fluctuating CO2 and O2 levels made this game more experimental and interesting, this system directly impacted on challenges to ecosystem management.</li>
    <li>Sandbox games are almost the complete opposite of the current gaming market's focus on being realistic and commercial. This actually enhances its accessibility, and its cute graphics, while seemingly simple, are highly scientific and educational, which fueled my desire to keep the fish alive.</li>
    </h5>

    <h3>Q5. What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?</h3>
    <h5>It would be even more interesting if the fish could grow and reproduce after eating food. This would make the game much more challenging, but also more engaging.</h5>

    <h3>Q6. What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what indicates this?</h3>
    <h5>On the info tab, it says, “Please: Play, Experiment, and Observe,” indicating that the game targets players who enjoy simulation games, eco-friendly themes, and sandbox experiences. It encourages players to be creative and experimental, discovering solutions on their own while having fun.</h5>

    <h3>Q7. What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?</h3>
    <h5>It was much harder to keep the fish alive than I thought, so I tried many times to find the most suitable ways to keep them alive by reading information.</h5>

    <h3>Q9. What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>
    <h5>It helped me develop a solution for maintaining an appropriate O2 to CO2 ratio. Furthermore, I investigated more articles and playing videos to explore how the ecosystem works within food chains.</h5>
